# Send Pixel GTM-Template

With this template you can send a GET request to any endpoint of your choice.

## Usage

- First provide the endpoint, where you want to send a GET request and your data in the corresponding field.
- In the table at the end of the tag template you can set up key-value-pairs, which will be send as query parameters.

## Notes

- The field for the endpoint is a required field and must start with "https://"
- You must provide at least one key-value-pair. The tag template will transform it into "key=value" and will put an ampersand as a separator between key-value-pairs.
